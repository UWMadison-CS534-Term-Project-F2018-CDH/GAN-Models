# GAN-Models
Collection of GANs created during development.

The autoencoder and comparison directories contain the results from the project.
Other networks in development, failed experiments, etc. should be placed in
the development directory.

All files should be Jupyter notebooks.

Models currently are designed for Keras and specifically the tensorflow backend.
We ran these notebooks using Google Colab however earlier models were trained
using Microsoft Azure.
